/**
 * The app's single slider implementation, so every slider matches instead of
 * each screen hand-rolling its own.
 *
 * This is the stock Material 3 slider with no custom track or thumb slot, which
 * is what makes it the current design rather than the 2023 one. The library
 * draws a wide bar handle with a gap in the active track and a stop indicator
 * under the finger, and widens all three while pressed; supplying a slot
 * replaces that whole treatment, so this deliberately passes none.
 *
 * The track is straight. The wavy treatment in this library belongs to the
 * progress indicators, not the slider, so the stock component already satisfies
 * that without a custom shape.
 *
 * Only the colour is customised, via the [SliderDefaults.colors] arguments, so
 * screens that tint a slider keep working while the geometry stays Material's.
