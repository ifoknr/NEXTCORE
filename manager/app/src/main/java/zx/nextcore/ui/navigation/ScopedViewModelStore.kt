/**
 * The ViewModel store a sub-screen should scope its `viewModel()` call to.
 *
 * A sub-screen normally wants its *parent's* store, so the parent and every
 * child below it share one ViewModel instance and one snapshot of state:
 * editing a resolution on the child and reading it back on the parent cannot
 * disagree.
 *
 * But the parent is not guaranteed to be on the stack. The dashboard's Quick
 * Profiles row navigates straight to any route in its rotation, so opening Game
 * Props Spoof from a tile lands on `integrity_gamespoof` with no
 * `integrity_spoofing` beneath it, and the unguarded
 * `getBackStackEntry("integrity_spoofing")` threw an IllegalArgumentException
 * on the main thread during composition — killing the process the moment that
 * screen opened.
 *
 * So: the requested parent when it is present, otherwise the screen's own
 * entry, otherwise the composition's owner. The decision itself is
 * [ScopedStore.resolve]; this only performs the lookups.
